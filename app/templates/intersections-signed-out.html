<p>
  Curious to see where you would have met
  {% with other_user as user %}{% include "user.snippet" %}{% endwith %}?
  {{ other_user.pronoun|capfirst }} has {{ other_user_checkins.length }}
  Foursquare checkins, perhaps you were at some of the same places too.
</p>

<p>
  Allow {{ APP_NAME }} to connect to your Foursquare account, and you'll find
  out (here's a <a href="/static/screenshot.png">screenshot</a> of what an
  intersection looks like).
</p>

<div class="button-container">
  <a href="{{ connect_url }}"><img src="/static/foursquare-button.png" width="150" height="24" alt="Connect with Foursquare"></a>
</div>

<p>
  Don't worry, we won't update your status or otherwise mess with your checkins.
</p>

<p>
  <br><br>
  Intrigued by the idea, but don't want to intersect your checkins with
  {{ other_user.first_name }}'s? Go to the <a href="/">homepage</a> to
  generate your own link.
