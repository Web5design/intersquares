  - include link to send to other people at the bottom
  - include more venue data in intersection

ideas
- stream on homepage with people who've recently signed up and want to be matched publicly
- mobile viewport
- stats for who tends to checkin first

later
- centralize urlfetch calls, use the same user agent
- make switching between users faster (switch from /authenticate to /authorize?)

done:
- store checkin history
- basic intersection display
- bucket intersections by day
- timezones
- get complete checkin history
- tweet link option after signing in
- favicon
- logo
- add "now what" section to logged in page with
  - url to give out for intersections requests
  - tweet button
  - QR code link
- fade in content after checkins are updated
- logo should link to homepage
- footer with name, link to source
- show year as a vertical bar along the left side of the intersection list
- homepage welcome text
