todo:
- get complete checkin history
- include venue data in intersection
- include checkin data in intersection (comments, photos, shouts)
- handle self/self intersection

ideas
- stream on homepage with people who've recently signed up and want to be matched publicly
- mobile version (generate QR code so that counterpart can quickly generate matches)
- tweet link option after signing in
- stats for who tends to checkin first

later
- api error handling
- centralize urlfetch calls, use the same user agent
- make switching between users faster (switch from /authenticate to /authorize?)

done:
- store checkin history
- basic intersection display
- bucket intersections by day
- timezones
