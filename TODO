  - map view
- intersections
  - handle intersections with friends
- good behavior
  - expose checkin clear handler
  - ereporter
  - handle oauth token revocation

  - don't use data > 24 hours old (check ToS)

ideas
- stream on homepage with people who've recently signed up and want to be matched publicly
- stats for who tends to checkin first

later
- centralize urlfetch calls, use the same user agent
