todo:
- ui
  - fade in content after checkins are updated
  - homepage welcome text
- intersection display
  - show year as a vertical bar along the left side of the intersection list
  - include more venue data in intersection
  - include checkin data in intersection (comments, photos, shouts)
  - include "also there" (either user's friends) in intersection
  - display all that on hover/click over an intersection
- intersection matchs
  - write matches (just other party's ID) to table
  - show recent matches on logged in homepage
  - option to email match notifications
- intersections
  - handle self/self intersections
  - handle intersections with friends
- good behavior
  - ereporter
  - handle oauth token revocation
  - api error handling
  - don't use data > 24 hours old (check ToS)


ideas
- stream on homepage with people who've recently signed up and want to be matched publicly
- mobile version (generate QR code so that counterpart can quickly generate matches)
- stats for who tends to checkin first
- on hover, show "also there" to show friends (of either user) that were at an intersected venue

later
- centralize urlfetch calls, use the same user agent
- make switching between users faster (switch from /authenticate to /authorize?)

done:
- store checkin history
- basic intersection display
- bucket intersections by day
- timezones
- get complete checkin history
- tweet link option after signing in
- favicon
- logo
- add "now what" section to logged in page with
  - url to give out for intersections requests
  - tweet button
  - QR code link
