todo:
- fade in content after checkins are updated
- include more venue data in intersection
- include checkin data in intersection (comments, photos, shouts)
- handle self/self intersection
- favicon
- logo
- ereporter
- handle oauth token revocation
- show year as a vertical bar along the left side of the intersection list

ideas
- stream on homepage with people who've recently signed up and want to be matched publicly
- mobile version (generate QR code so that counterpart can quickly generate matches)
- tweet link option after signing in
- stats for who tends to checkin first
- on hover, show "also there" to show friends (of either user) that were at an intersected venue

later
- api error handling
- centralize urlfetch calls, use the same user agent
- make switching between users faster (switch from /authenticate to /authorize?)

done:
- store checkin history
- basic intersection display
- bucket intersections by day
- timezones
- get complete checkin history
